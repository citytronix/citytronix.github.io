		<p>Greenhouse Grenade is an electronica track I created and released initially via SoundCloud, thereafter - after some time - I distributed the track on 3rd March on all major services and platforms. Unlike many other songs, this one particularly utilised more hardware equipment such as the D-50 roland synthesiser that I'd recorded and using more outboard equipment, it is by far one of my most cherished pieces.

		<br><br>The inspiration of this piece stemmed from Nancy Sinatra; I find her image, work ethic and music career to be compelling. Her whimsical and lighthearted mannerisms feel like the best traits you can obtain to conquer the worlds issues of being a woman.</p>

	<div><h2>Beyond (CITYTRONIX Remix) by Jameson Hodge & Waller [2017]</h2>
		<p>I did a remix as part of a B side for Jameson Hodge & Waller's 'Form' mini-album, a release via Insight Music. The album is distributed digitally and physically in CD format, which is available to purchase on Insight Music's webpage.</p>

	<div><h2>Calling For Your Warmth by CityTronix (2015)</h2>
		<p>In 2015 I became a fraction of / and made my debut release via the collective "Purity", formed by Kaizen and Yoe Mase. The release itself managed to amass over 100k listens on SoundCloud (and counting), whilst also recieving approval from a number of artists and average listeners. The track itself is progressive house - with sweet plucked melodies, pitched cavernous vocal cuts and smooth basslines. Click the image to take a listen!</p>

	<div><h2>Melancholia by Konnektion (2015)</h2>
		<p>Initially released in 2015, Konnektion was another psuedonym I created as part of a side project that was later abolished. The first release under Konnektion, 'Melancholia', has had widespread recognition consequently exceeding a million views collectively on YouTube alone, and used most notably by YouTube user Jordan Clark with her DIY uploads.

	<h4 class="selectDisable" style="font-family: 'Syncopate', sans-serif;">About</h4>
	<p class="selectDisable" class="about" style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">Drew Holliday, aka CITYTRONIX is an electronica based musician, programmer and visual artist based in United Kingdom. CITYTRONIX first conceived music creation at her earliest years, primarily arranging pieces of soundbites and MIDI riffs on numerous PlayStation platform releases namely Music 3000 and MTV Music Generator 2 - it is with no doubt that CITYTRONIX has always been an avid sound explorer and audiophile.<br><br>

CITYTRONIX's sound is a form of communicating her timelines in life, by capturing sound souvenirs in which has moulded her identity in both crisis and reassurance - encompassing pop music culture, documentaries, sound triggers, low fidelity YouTube videos, objects and just about anything you can imagine or envisage. Sound reaches no bounds, especially when it comes to what is felt within — it is limitless.<br><br>If you'd like to contact me for enquiries, bookings and any other commissions such as sound design and composition, hover over to the email icon, or email - <p href="mailto:citytronix@gmail.com" style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif; color: white; text-decoration: none;">citytronix@gmail.com</p></p>
